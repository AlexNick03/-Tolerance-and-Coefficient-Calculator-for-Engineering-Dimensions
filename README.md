# -Tolerance-and-Coefficient-Calculator-for-Engineering-Dimensions
This is a c++ project which shows the concept of a Tolerance-and-Coefficient-Calculato
It performs the following functionalities:
  Dimension Validation: Requests the user to input a valid dimension within a specified range.
  Tolerance Calculation: Computes the tolerance based on provided upper and lower deviations.
  CSV File Processing:
    Reads data from files like tabelIT.csv and kn.csv to extract dimensions and corresponding values.
  Dimension Rounding: Matches the input dimension to the nearest predefined value.
  Determining IT Grade: Identifies the tolerance grade (IT) corresponding to the dimension and deviation.
  Tolerance Factor Calculation: Computes specific coefficients (Kn, i, Tn) using engineering formulas.
  Interactive Interface: Allows users to repeat calculations for different dimensions or exit the program.
